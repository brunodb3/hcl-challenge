Consists in the back-end solution for solving the challenge presented by HCL for the Javascript Fullstack developer role.

## Installing / First steps

Before cloning the repository, make sure you have [NodeJS >= v8](https://nodejs.org/en/) (mine is version 10.14.1).

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies with `npm i` or `npm install`. Then, make sure to create the `.env` file from `.env.example`, so the server can have it's environment properly set up.

## Running the server

To run the server locally, you should run `npm start`. This will fire up at `localhost:PORT` (default PORT is 5000 - see `.env.example`).
